Program: Prog1 (Point Processes)

Class: CSC 443, Introduction to Image Processing

Professor: Dr. John Weiss

Meeting Time & Place: 9:00 am M-W-F in McLaury 305

Authors: Derek Stotz, Dan Andrus (QtImageLib by Dr. John Weiss)

Last Modified: Feb 6, 2015

Compiling: Run qmake to compile.

Usage:   ./prog1

Details - The purpose of this assignment was to implement most of the point
 *         processess described in class.  While the GUI elements were provided
 *         by Qt and QtImageLib, the only code we had to implement was for
 *         modifying the images themselves.  Each function of ours was passed
 *         a QtImageLib image, which acted as a 2 dimensional vector of pixel
 *         information.  We were able to either generate and analyze the image
 *         histogram to modify the intensity distributions or simply modify each
 *         individual pixel value to implement the point proccesses required.

 *         We split our work roughly in half.  Dan's processes are under a different
 *         Menu than Derek's, and the ImageLib functions which we used for reference
 *         remain under and Image Lib menu.


 Recommended Usage -
 *           Simply open an image using the open icon and modify it using the functions
 *           found under the two menus.  To reset the image, press the back arrow in the
 *           image window.

 Issues and Bugs - Our histogram equalization gives slightly (barely detectably) different
 *           results from the ImageLib equalization.  Actually, in some cases of clipping
 *           values between 0 and 1, our equalization worked correctly while the ImageLib
 *           equalization only gave partially equalized results.
 *
 *           Some processes are not included in the ImageLibProcessor, but this was not
 *           required and we were merely using it for reference.
